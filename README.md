**Description:**


Chaos Chess is a unique, team-based, text-only variation of traditional chess that introduces an exciting layer of unpredictability and strategy to the classic game. It features a two-team setup: Team White and Team Black, each consisting of a Player and a Spotter. The twist in Chaos Chess comes from the Spotters' limited knowledge of the game's state. They can only suggest a type of piece to move, without seeing the current board layout. The Players, following their Spotters' instructions, must move the specified piece type if possible, adding a strategic challenge and an element of surprise to every move.

The game follows a specific sequence of play, where each Spotter calls out a piece type, and the corresponding Player moves that piece. If a Spotter suggests a piece that cannot be legally moved, it's considered a "FAULT," and they're allowed another attempt. Three consecutive faults without a legal move result in forfeiture. Standard chess rules apply, but the team dynamics and Spotter's blind calls introduce chaos into the strategy, making each game unpredictable.

Chaos Chess is enriched with random chaotic messages displayed upon capturing a piece, contributing to the game's whimsical and unpredictable nature. Options to start a new game, save progress, load a saved game, and exit are available, ensuring a user-friendly experience. The game is entirely text-based, providing a conversational and engaging gameplay experience, guided by clear instructions and feedback at every step.

Chaos Chess offers a refreshing twist on traditional chess, requiring players to adapt to the unpredictable challenges posed by their teammate's limited knowledge. It's a test of trust, strategy, and adaptability, making every game a new adventure in chaos.
